		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<p> We are an affordable Medical Centre that strives to do as much

		<h3> Book Your Appointments Online </h3>
		<p> We now allow you to book your appointments online, which is much more
			convenient than physically booking an appointment, and the best part
			is... You get to choose the date, if there are no more spaces available
			on the chosen day, we will look for the closes available one, and contact
			you to confirm. </p>
		<br>
		<!-- Shows information about the online payment system. -->
		<h4> Make Payments Online </h4>
		<p>	The same as with the appointments, the option to process a payment is now
			available online. All you need is your banking details and you are good to
			go. There is no complicated process attached to it, it is like simple online banking.
			Keep in mind that whether you have Medical Aid or not, the banking process should
			still be followed in case of any complications with the Medical Aid process.</p>

			will be delivered to the centre. You will then have to come and pick it up, but there
			is no extra cost, and you get just what you ordered, so order medicine through us now!</p>
